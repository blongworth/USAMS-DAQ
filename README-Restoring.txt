To restore DAQ PC Backups

1. Copy current XIA directory to C:
2. Copy current Labview directory to C:\Users\ams254\Documents

Current Labview vi is in \Labview\NOSAMSSNICSDAQ\NOSAMSBouncerDAQ.vi.

A compiled version of the VI is in \Labview\builds\NOSAMSBouncerDAQ\NOSAMSBouncerDAQ\Application.exe. 

If reinstalling windows, you'll need to check that the PIXIE drivers
